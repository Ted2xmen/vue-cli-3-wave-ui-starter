## Important
```
<w-app>
  <!-- All your app's content goes here. -->
</w-app>
```

This tag is required in your app for Wave UI proper functioning.
You should place it at the root of your app.
There should only be one <w-app> in your whole app.

- By default, the w-app wrapper will have a flex layout with a column direction, and a height of 100% of the full HTML document.

(from Wave UI documentation)
